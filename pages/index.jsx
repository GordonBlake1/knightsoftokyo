            Welcome to the dark corner of the Earth. I&apos;m Gordon Blake and
            these are the lists of my favorite movies of each year. Where&apos;s
            the 19xx year? you might ask. Where&apos;s the 20xx? As of today,
            I&apos;ve completed my journey through the{' '}
            <span style={{ color: '#f9c7d5' }}>...&mdash;1923</span> years. You
            should exercise a great deal of precaution if encountering any list
            not belonging to the mentioned time period: it&apos;s probably a
            placeholder.
          </p>
          {/* Insert an image of 20xx year with bullshit entries */}

            It&apos;s not really a biggie in a grand scheme of things, just
            sitting there, observing frames change 24 times per second. What the
            hell, I just might be the best watcher there is. But there&apos;s a
            difference between seeing things and &quot;seeing things&quot;. So,
            do I &quot;see things&quot;? I watch things. I look into things. I
            observe. See Saw, Have Seen. Have Been Seen To Have Seeing Things.
            From the safest distance possible, mind you. We&apos;re not here to
            get affected, are we.

            When we critique movies, we often resort to the superficial method
            of evaluating them with a number, which can severely impair
            one&apos;s appreciation for cinema. Our memories diligently sort and
            file away anything that doesn&apos;t meet our arbitrary criteria,
            consigning those &quot;lesser&quot; movies to the dark recesses of
            our minds until they are forgotten entirely. I don&apos;t want this
            to happen to my besties. I had strings, but now I&apos;m free.

            for the idea of a color coded rating system, which I may or may not
            understand myself, but I&apos;m using it anyways throughout my
            lists. Each color represents how much I liked the film, and has the
            folowing progression, from highest to lowest:
